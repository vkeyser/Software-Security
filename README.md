# Software-Security


### Briefly summarize your client and their software requirements. 
Artemis Financial, a financial services company, seeks Global Rain's expertise to modernize its operations through the development of custom software. 
The company focuses on implementing the most current and effective security measures to protect against external threats.

### What did you do well when you found your client's software security vulnerability? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?
I conducted thorough software security testing for my client by scanning the codebase, performing penetration testing, and reviewing access controls. 
I communicated my findings effectively, providing clear explanations and actionable recommendations for remediation.
Secure coding is crucial for protecting sensitive data, preserving user trust, and mitigating financial and reputational risks. 
It also promotes reliability and longevity, minimizing the need for costly post-release fixes and maintenance.
Investing in software security adds substantial value to a company's wellbeing by safeguarding assets, reputation, and competitiveness. 
A secure software ecosystem fosters customer confidence, ensures compliance, and enhances operational efficiency. 
Ultimately, prioritizing software security aligns with the company's long-term sustainability and growth objectives.


### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The entire project was challenging, but overall, I enjoyed troubleshooting errors that I created and having that "lightbulb went off" moment when I finally figured out the error and fixed it. 

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I would increase security layers by implementing encryption, access controls, regular security patches, and possibly employing multi-factor authentication. 
In the future, to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use, I would utilize a combination of automated tools like vulnerability scanners and penetration testing along with manual security audits by experienced professionals. 
This holistic approach helps identify weaknesses and prioritize mitigation techniques based on their potential impact and feasibility.

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and software application were both functional and secure, I conducted thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. 
Additionally, I performed security testing, such as vulnerability scanning, code reviews, and penetration testing, to identify and address potential security flaws.
After refactoring the code, I conducted regression testing to verify that the changes did not introduce new bugs or affect the application's functionality. 
To check for new vulnerabilities introduced during refactoring, I conducted another round of security testing, focusing specifically on areas of the code that were modified. 
This involved using automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities and manual inspection by security experts to identify any potential weaknesses that may have been introduced.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future mitigation or tasks?
I used testing and scanning tools to ensure the code's proper functioning. Security tools helped check for vulnerabilities and manage changes effectively. 
Code reviews with peers helped maintain quality standards. 
Following safety guidelines and documenting the software's safety measures made future modifications easier.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of your work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
To showcase my skills and experience to future employers, I would present my comprehensive testing strategies, highlight feedback from code reviews, discuss security measures implemented, present version control history, and share documentation of code modifications made during refactoring.
